Temperature Monitor using RMI

This is a project for the Distributed Computing course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. It consists in five different servers for five different cities, each one of them informing the current temperature of the city. The client has the option to choose one city and receive notifications when the current temperature is below or above a certain threshold established by the user.
